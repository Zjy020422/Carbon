The primary customers for our platform are major international airlines, government and aviation regulatory agencies, and participants in carbon compliance markets.
Major international airlines, such as those based in Europe are the core users. With regulations like the EU's "Fit for 55", avoiding contrails becomes financially urgent. These airlines are under direct compliance pressure, and thus have both the motivation and the financial resources to invest.
Government and aviation regulatory agencies represent another critical segment. They urgently need regulatory tools to assess and monitor the non-CO2 emissions across the entire industry. Our system provides monitoring and accounting tools needed to close this regulatory gap.
Carbon market participants require trusted data a monitoring tool. Our solution can serve as standard for contrail-impact accounting, adding credibility and completeness to the carbon trading ecosystem.
The addressable market within aviation carbon footprint management is significant. According to industry projections aligned with the EU's "Fit for 55" regulations, approximately 35 major airlines operating in the EU will require contrail management solutions for compliance by 2027. Based on market analysis from Eurocontrol and vendor case studies (e.g., SATAVIA), the estimated average annual contract value for such solutions is €500,000 per airline, representing an immediate addressable market of €17.5 million annually.
In most cases, the buyer and payer are the same entity—the airline purchasing and using the service. 
The industry ecosystem is policy-driven, with regulations creating immediate demand. This regulatory pressure directly compels airlines to invest in new technological solutions to ensure compliance and avoid substantial future carbon costs. The market is currently primarily focusing on calculating CO₂ emissions by established carbon management platforms, largely lacking the capability to integrate the critical climate impact of contrails into their assessments. Concurrently, partnerships between technology companies and airlines are emerging to explore practical applications. However, these efforts remain fragmented, which underscores the need for our platform to unite them.
