The business model for our system operates on a dual-engine revenue model centered on serving aviation and regulatory stakeholders, with cost allocations aligned to its core operational requirements. Its core revenue comes from SaaS subscription fees, which are billed to airlines either annually or monthly and structured with tiered pricing based on factors like fleet size, route coverage volume, data query capacity, and report functionality to match varying customer needs. Complementing this are value-added revenue streams: professional consulting and customized development services, which provide airlines with in-depth emission reduction path planning and tailored report template development; API data access, which charges government bodies, aviation regulatory agencies, and carbon exchanges on a pay-per-use basis; and customized analysis reports designed specifically for regulatory institutions. The model targets two main customer groups—core clients being airlines, and secondary clients including regulators and carbon exchanges—with service offerings split into core SaaS subscription services and supplementary options like API access, custom report creation, and personalized function development. On the cost side, the platform incurs three key types of expenses: technology costs covering ongoing investments in model and data algorithm optimization; hardware costs for data procurement and high-performance server deployment; and labor costs associated with sales teams, as well as teams focused on early-stage market cultivation and technical promotion. For unit pricing and delivery costs, the SaaS service is priced between 50,000 and 200,000 CNY per airline annually, adjusted based on specific functions and demands; customized reports are priced at 20,000 to 50,000 CNY per copy; and API data access follows a pay-per-use structure (with specific rates not specified), while corresponding delivery costs include annual expenditures for data procurement, server maintenance, and continuous model and algorithm optimization.
